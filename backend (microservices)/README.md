# 🏗️ Architecture

- Microservices architecture
- API Gateway pattern
- Service discovery via Eureka
- Event-driven communication using RabbitMQ
- REST APIs for inter-service communication
- Centralized authentication with Keycloak

# 🔄 System Flow

1. Client sends request via API Gateway
2. Gateway authenticates request (Keycloak)
3. Request routed to appropriate microservice
4. Services communicate via:
   - OpenFeign (sync)
   - RabbitMQ (async events)

5. Response returned to client

---

# 📡 Event-Driven Communication

RabbitMQ is used for:

- Booking → Payment updates
- Payment → Notification events
- Booking → Notification triggers

---

# 🔗 Inter-Service Communication

- Feign Clients used across services:
  - User Service
  - Salon Service
  - Payment Service
  - Category Service

---

# 🔐 Security

- Keycloak-based authentication
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control:
  - Admin
  - Customer
  - Salon Owner

---

# ⚙️ Setup Instructions

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Full-Stack-Salon-Booking-Web-App.git
cd backend
```

---

## 2️⃣ Start Infrastructure (Docker)

```bash
cd docker-compose/default
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` file:

```env
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
RAZORPAY_KEY=your_key
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
```

---

## 4️⃣ Run Services

Start services in order:

1. Eureka Server
2. Gateway Server
3. User Service
4. Other microservices

```bash
cd <service-name>
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### User Service

- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/register`
- `/users`

### Booking Service

- `/bookings`
- `/slots`
- `/history`

### Salon Service

- `/salons`
- `/services`

### Payment Service

- `/payments`
- `/orders`

### Notification Service

- `/notifications`
